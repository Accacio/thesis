We study also the finite element approximation of such problems, compatible with the use of our algorithm. The method is finally applied to solve several problems of continuum mechanics.},

The result of this development is that there now exists a significant number of elegant and practically results in the field of robust control under real parameter uncertainty. This subject is rich in theoretical content, easy to motivate from a practical standpoint and requires just the right level of mathematics to be taught as a fundamental discipline to engineers and scientists.},

  abstract   = {The classical condition number is a very rough measure of the effect of perturbations on the inverse of a square matrix. First, it assumes that the perturbation is infinitesimally small. Second, it does not take into account the perturbation structure (e.g., Vandermonde). Similarly, the classical notion of the inverse of a matrix neglects the possibility of large, structured perturbations. We define a new quantity, the structured maximal inversion error, that takes into account both structure and non-necessarily small perturbation size. When the perturbation is infinitesimal, we obtain a “structured condition number”. We introduce the notion of approximate inverse, as a matrix that best approximates the inverse of a matrix with structured perturbations, when the perturbation varies in a given range. For a wide class of perturbation structures, we show how to use (convex) semidefinite programming to compute bounds on the structured maximal inversion error and structured condition number, and compute an approximate inverse. The results are exact when the perturbation is “unstructured”—we then obtain an analytic expression for the approximate inverse. When the perturbation is unstructured and additive, we recover the classical condition number; the approximate inverse is the operator related to the Total Least Squares (orthogonal regression) problem.},

In this precise area of building thermal modelling issues of model accuracy and computational efficiency become important. In this work a nonlinear constrained optimization method is used for reducing the model order of building elements. The approach involves minimizing the error between the step response of a high-order reference model whilst tuning the parameters of a lower order model in order to obtain an optimized reduced-order model. Results show that a reduced model based on a 2nd-order building element gives minimal loss of accuracy but significant improvements in computational effort when treating both high and low thermal capacity modelling problems.},

When the iteration is assumed symmetric, the problem of finding the fastest converging linear iteration can be cast as a semidefinite program, and therefore efficiently and globally solved. These optimal linear iterations are often substantially faster than several common heuristics that are based on the Laplacian of the associated graph. We show how problem structure can be exploited to speed up interior-point methods for solving the fastest distributed linear iteration problem, for networks with up to a thousand or so edges. We also describe a simple subgradient method that handles far larger problems, with up to 100000 edges. We give several extensions and variations on the basic problem.},

  abstract = {We consider a stochastic model for distributed average consensus, which arises in applications such as load balancing for parallel processors, distributed coordination of mobile autonomous agents, and network synchronization. In this model, each node updates its local variable with a weighted average of its neighbors’ values, and each new value is corrupted by an additive noise with zero mean. The quality of consensus can be measured by the total mean-square deviation of the individual variables from their average, which converges to a steady-state value. We consider the problem of finding the (symmetric) edge weights that result in the least mean-square deviation in steady state. We show that this problem can be cast as a convex optimization problem, so the global solution can be found efficiently. We describe some computational methods for solving this problem, and compare the weights and the mean-square deviations obtained by this method and several other weight design methods.},

  title     = {Parameter Estimation for Mechanical Systems Using an Extended Kalman Filter},
  year      = {2008},
  month     = {12},
  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new computational approach based on the
                  Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in order to apply the polynomial
                  chaos theory to the problem of parameter estimation, using
                  direct stochastic collocation. The Kalman filter formula is
                  used at each time step in order to update the polynomial chaos
                  of the uncertain states and the uncertain parameters. The main
                  advantage of this method is that the estimation comes in the
                  form of a probability density function rather than a
                  deterministic value, combined with the fact that simulations
                  using polynomial chaos methods are much faster than Monte
                  Carlo simulations. The proposed method is applied to a
                  nonlinear four degree of freedom roll plane model of a
                  vehicle, in which an uncertain mass with an uncertain position
                  is added on the roll bar. A major drawback was identified: the
                  EKF can diverge when using a high sampling frequency, which
                  might prevent the use of enough data to obtain accurate
                  results when a low sampling frequency is necessary. When
                  applying the polynomial chaos theory to the EKF, numerical
                  errors can accumulate even faster than in the general case due
                  to the truncation in the polynomial chaos expansions, which is
                  illustrated on a simple example. An alternative EKF approach
                  which consists of applying the filter formula on all the
                  observations at once usually yields better results, but can
                  still sometimes fail to produce very accurate results.
                  Therefore, using different sampling rates in order to verify
                  the coherence of the results and comparing the results to a
                  different approach is strongly recommended.},

  abstract  = {A power grid is a complex system connecting electric power generators to consumers through power transmission and distribution networks across a large geographical area. System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of power grids, and state estimation is used in system monitoring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements, including the interacting bad measurements introduced by arbitrary, non-random causes. At first glance, it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious measurements injected by attackers.In this paper, we present a new class of attacks, called false data injection attacks, against state estimation in electric power grids. We show that an attacker can exploit the configuration of a power system to launch such attacks to successfully introduce arbitrary errors into certain state variables while bypassing existing techniques for bad measurement detection. Moreover, we look at two realistic attack scenarios, in which the attacker is either constrained to some specific meters (due to the physical protection of the meters), or limited in the resources required to compromise meters. We show that the attacker can systematically and efficiently construct attack vectors in both scenarios, which can not only change the results of state estimation, but also modify the results in arbitrary ways. We demonstrate the success of these attacks through simulation using IEEE test systems. Our results indicate that security protection of the electric power grid must be revisited when there are potentially malicious attacks.},

This type of monitoring and control infrastructure is also common for many other water distribution systems. We present a linearized shallow water partial differential equation (PDE) system that can model water flow in a network of canal pools which are equipped with lateral offtakes for water withdrawal and are connected by automated gates. The knowledge of the system dynamics enables us to develop a deception attack scheme based on switching the PDE parameters and proportional (P) boundary control actions, to withdraw water from the pools through offtakes. We briefly discuss the limits on detectability of such attacks. We use a known formulation based on low frequency approximation of the PDE model and an associated proportional integral (PI) controller, to create a stealthy deception scheme capable of compromising the performance of the closed-loop system. We test the proposed attack scheme in simulation, using a shallow water solver; and show that the attack is indeed realizable in practice by implementing it on a physical canal in Southern France: the Gignac canal. A successful field experiment shows that the attack scheme enables us to steal water stealthily from the canal until the end of the attack.},

                  vehicles (UAVs), this paper introduces a new cooperative
                  distributed trajectory optimization approach for systems with
                  independent dynamics but coupled objectives and hard
                  constraints. The overall goal is to develop a distributed
                  approach that solves small subproblems while minimizing a
                  fleet-level objective. In the new algorithm, vehicles solve
                  their subproblems in sequence while generating feasible
                  modifications to the prediction of other vehicles' plans. In
                  order to avoid reproducing the global optimization, the
                  decisions of other vehicles are parameterized using a much
                  smaller number of variables than in the centralized
                  formulation. This reduced number of variables is sufficient to
                  improve the cooperation between vehicles without significantly
                  increasing the computational effort involved. The resulting
                  algorithm is shown to be robustly feasible under the action of
                  unknown but bounded disturbances. Furthermore, the fleet
                  objective function is proven to monotonically decrease as the
                  algorithm cycles through the vehicles in the fleet and over
                  the time. The results from simulations and a hardware
                  experiment demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve
                  the fleet objective by temporarily having one vehicle
                  sacrifice its individual objective, showing the cooperative
                  behavior.},

                  consumers with flexible
power consumption. Each consumer is under the jurisdiction of exactly one
                  balancing responsible
party (BRP), who buys energy at a day-ahead electricity market on behalf of the
                  consumer.
We illustrate how BRPs can utilize the flexibility of the consumers to minimize
                  the imbalance
between the consumed and the purchased energy thereby avoiding trading balancing
                  energy at
unfavorable prices. Further we show how shadow prices on the distribution lines
                  can be used to
resolve grid congestion without information sharing between the BRPs.},

  abstract        = {In reality, a system is almost nonlinear. To estimate the
                  parameter or state of this system, nonlinear approach is
                  needed. The Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) and the Unscented
                  Kalman Filter(UKF) are used to estimate this nonlinear
                  problem. EKF uses first order Taylor expansion to approximate
                  the nonlinear system, while UKF performs a stochastic
                  linearization by using a weighted statistical linear
                  regression process. The purpose of this paper is to estimate
                  the state of the nonlinear suspension system based on the
                  Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter. The
                  simulation deals with state estimation of nonlinear suspension
                  system by using these filters and is compared with the true
                  state. Also LQR controller and output feedback PD controller
                  will be designed by aid of UKF and EKF estimation. Simulation
                  results show that two nonlinear Kalman filters are effective
                  in estimating the state of a nonlinear suspension system.},

  abstract = {This article studies security decisions of identical plant-controller systems, when their security is interdependent due to network induced risks. Each plant is modeled by a discrete-time stochastic linear system, with the systems controlled over a shared communication network. We formulate the problem of security choices of the individual system operators (also called players) as a non-cooperative game. We consider a two-stage game, in which on the first stage the players decide whether to invest in security or not; and on the second stage, they apply control inputs to minimize the average operational costs. We characterize the equilibria of the game, which includes the determination of the individually optimal security levels. Next, we solve the problem of finding the socially optimal security levels. The presence of interdependent security causes a negative externality, and the individual players tend to under invest in security relative to the social optimum. This leads to a gap between the individual and the socially optimal security levels for a wide range of security costs. From our results, regulatory impositions to incentivize higher security investments are desirable.},

The compensator is formed as a weighted sum of stable filters. An identification-based procedure for adaptive tuning of the coefficients is proposed for the case of unknown disturbance. We also propose a time-invariant compensator that provides perfect attenuation of a disturbance for the case when a model identification error is sufficiently small and disturbance frequencies are known. The technique is applied to a case study on a challenging benchmark example in the field of active vibration control. Attenuation of a disturbance formed as a sum of up to three sinusoidal signals with unknown/time-varying frequencies is demonstrated via simulation and experimental studies.},

The concept with multi-agent intelligent control may become a viable solution for Smart Grid architecture. The proposed control architecture contains many agents such as Control agent, Load agent and DER agent who are participatory in quick decision making for Microgrid control. The multi-agent controller is implemented using an open source agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Simulation is carried out in Matlab environment. MACsimJX is used to interface the Simulink model with Multi agent system. The simulation has been carried out during normal, fault and over load conditions. The simulation results indicate that the proposed Multi-agent based controller coordinate effectively with different loads in Microgrid to ensure continuity of power supply to critical loads during normal, fault and overload conditions.},

The algorithm achieves convergence rate O(1k2), where k is the iteration number, which significantly improves the convergence rates of existing duality-based distributed optimization algorithms that achieve O(1k). The performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated on randomly generated optimization problems arising in distributed model predictive control (DMPC). The evaluation shows that, when the problem data is sparse and large-scale, our algorithm can outperform current state-of-the-art optimization software CPLEX and MOSEK.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of resilient in-network consensus
                  in the presence of misbehaving nodes. Secure and
                  fault-tolerant consensus algorithms typically assume knowledge
                  of nonlocal information; however, this assumption is not
                  suitable for large-scale dynamic networks. To remedy this, we
                  focus on local strategies that provide resilience to faults
                  and compromised nodes. We design a consensus protocol based on
                  local information that is resilient to worst-case security
                  breaches, assuming the compromised nodes have full knowledge
                  of the network and the intentions of the other nodes. We
                  provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the normal
                  nodes to reach asymptotic consensus despite the influence of
                  the misbehaving nodes under different threat assumptions. We
                  show that traditional metrics such as connectivity are not
                  adequate to characterize the behavior of such algorithms, and
                  develop a novel graph-theoretic property referred to as
                  network robustness. Network robustness formalizes the notion
                  of redundancy of direct information exchange between subsets
                  of nodes in the network, and is a fundamental property for
                  analyzing the behavior of certain distributed algorithms that
                  use only local information.},

The agents are responsible for the acquisition and computation of emergent data arising from the interaction of the various agent entities within the microgrid. Individual agents and their functions are mapped with operations that are custom-framed for the rural Indian microgrid scenario. The framework developed for the modeling of a single microgrid MAS allows for effective control and better operation. The agents designed in this microgrid typically fall into one of the three broad categories of DG agents, Mu agents and D agents. In the rural Indian context, the Load agent, the Grid Agent, the DER agent and the Storage agent are typically DG agents. The Communication agent is the Mu agent and the Control agent is the D agent. The design philosophy has been proposed keeping in mind that the Indian rural microgrid has renewable sources (namely solar, wind, and biogas), storage, and intermittent grid supply as energy sources.},

The proposed algorithm, called URLS, removes the noise-induced bias when both input and output are contaminated with noise and the input noise is colored and correlated with the output noise. To develop the algorithm, we define an exponentially-weighted least-squares optimization problem that yields an unbiased estimate. Then, we solve the system of linear equations of the associated normal equations utilizing the dichotomous coordinate-descent iterations. The URLS algorithm features significantly reduced computational complexity as well as improved numerical stability compared with a previously proposed bias-compensated recursive least-squares algorithm while having similar estimation performance. We show that the URLS algorithm is asymptotically unbiased and convergent in the mean-square sense. We also calculate its steady-state mean-square deviation. Simulation results corroborate the efficacy of the URLS algorithm and the accuracy of the theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a general problem setup for a wide class of convex and robust distributed optimization problems in peer-to-peer networks. In this setup, convex constraint sets are distributed to the network processors who have to compute the optimizer of a linear cost function subject to the constraints. We propose a novel fully distributed and asynchronous algorithm, named cutting-plane consensus, to solve the problem, based on a polyhedral outer approximation of the constraint sets. Processors running the algorithm compute and exchange linear approximations of their locally feasible sets. Independently of the number of processors in the network, each processor stores only a small number of linear constraints, making the algorithm scalable to large networks. The cutting-plane consensus algorithm is presented and analyzed for the general framework. Specifically, we prove
                  the correctness of the algorithm, and show its robustness
                  against communication or processor failures. Then, the
                  cutting-plane consensus algorithm is specified to three
                  different classes of distributed optimization problems, namely
                  1) inequality constrained problems, 2) robust optimization
                  problems, and 3) almost separable optimization problems. For
                  each one of these problem classes we solve a concrete problem

Specifically, a fault detection method based on a geometric approach is applied to two different settings. Depending on the availability of phasor measurement units, we develop indirect and direct methods and compare their characteristics in performance and computation.

                  doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) play an increasingly
                  essential role in the power industry. It has been well
                  recognized that modeling and monitoring the dynamic behavior
                  of DFIGs are important to ensure power system reliability.
                  Real-time estimation of the dynamic states of a DFIG is
                  possible with high-speed measurements. But how to use such
                  measurements to have high-quality estimation remains to be a
                  challenge. Estimating dynamic states relies on a good dynamic
                  model of the DFIG. Building a high-fidelity model is a problem
                  in tandem with the dynamic state estimation problem. In this
                  paper, we propose an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based
                  method for the state estimation and parameter calibration of a
                  DFIG. The mathematical formulation of state estimation
                  combining with parameter estimation is presented. Simulation
                  cases were studied to demonstrate the accuracy of both dynamic
                  state estimation and parameter estimation. Sensitivity
                  analysis is performed with respect to the measurement noise,
                  initial state errors and parameter errors. The results
                  indicate this EnKF-based method has a robust performance on
                  the state estimation and parameter calibration of a DFIG.},

  abstract = {Urban energy management nowadays has put more focus on residential
                  houses energy consumption. Lots of machine learning based
                  data-driven approaches have the abilities to characterize and
                  forecast total energy consumption of commercial data. However,
                  a paucity of research applying data-driven methods have been
                  tested on the hour ahead energy consumption forecast for
                  typical single family houses in the US. With the advances in
                  smart metering, sub meter usages forecast in household-level
                  is also getting more and more popular on smart building
                  control and demand response program. The situation here
                  inspires us to develop a hybrid model to address the problem
                  of residential hour and day ahead load forecasting through the
                  integration of data-driven techniques with a physics-based
                  model. In this article, we report on the evaluations of five
                  different machine learning algorithms, artificial neural
                  network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), least-square
                  support vector machine (LS-SVM), Gaussian process regression
                  (GPR) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), applied to four
                  residential data set that contains smart meters. Both total
                  and non-air conditioning (AC) power consumption are forecasted
                  for hour ahead and 24-h ahead. The variation of patterns
                  captured from non-AC part is further input as internal heat
                  gain to a physics-based model. The model uses a 2R-1C thermal
                  network and an AC regression model. By utilizing this hybrid
                  approach, we get AC load prediction and non-AC energy forecast
                  simultaneously. Total energy consumption is further produced
                  by summing up the two sub meters forecast for hybrid model.
                  The results from new modeling are compared with those from
                  pure data-driven techniques. The final result showing
                  improvements of coefficient of variance between the best
                  data-driven model and hybrid model are 6–10% and 2–15% for
                  hour ahead and 24-h ahead, respectively.},

In contrast, various types of distributed energy resources (DERs) with different characteristics and of different capacities exist in a microgrid system, and client-server architecture and centralized control are inadequate for control and operation purpose. In this study, an example microgrid system with a multi-agent system which complies with FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) standard is proposed and built using MATLAB/Simulink and Java Agent Development Framework (JADE). The operations of and among the intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), circuit breakers (CBs), calculation agent and CB agents in the example microgrid system for fault protection coordination under both normal and short-circuit fault conditions are analyzed and discussed. The results demonstrate that protection coordination can be correctly planned and control actions can be executed properly by the multi-agent system in the microgrid system, and the multi-agent system can isolate the fault area and protect the microgrid system in real time under varies conditions.},

A micro-grid can be operated in parallel with the conventional grid or isolated mode, is one of the key enabling components of a smart grid. The dynamics of the system, due to the penetration of highly intermittent and unpredictable distributed energy resources changes. Thus, the control strategies become difficult and for improving the performance of the existing system an advanced energy management is required. The microgrid energy management should be capable of balancing supply and demand at every instant and also ensure further requirements like flexibility, reliability, fault tolerance and reduction in operation costs, etc. In this paper, a multi agent based energy management system is proposed and simulated with and without the agent based management for 24-hour real time scenario to analyze the performance of the proposed scheme. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed system in the presence of different events occurred in the system.},

  abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which are an integration of computation, networking, and physical processes, play an increasingly important role in critical infrastructure, government and everyday life. Due to physical constraints, embedded computers and networks may give rise to some additional security vulnerabilities, which results in losses of enormous economy benefits or disorder of social life. As a result, it is of significant to properly investigate the security issue of CPSs to ensure that such systems are operating in a safe manner. This paper, from a control theory perspective, presents an overview of recent advances on security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs. First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to cater for the requirement of the performance analysis. Then three typical types of cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, and deception attacks, are disclosed from an engineering perspective. Moreover, robustness, security and resilience as well as stability are discussed to govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is reviewed according to the categories on detection approaches. Furthermore, the security control and state estimation are discussed in detail. Finally, some challenge issues are raised for the future research.},

grids is designed to improve power system stability by reducing
the concurrent peak power demand. The DR is based on
dynamic prices where grid operators provide guideline prices
that help consumers adapt their consumption. The guideline
prices are not usually used in billing, they are provided as an
indication of the real-time prices. The savings in the power
consumption are driven by the flexibility in electricity demand.
Smart homes using the DR technology require support from
communication systems associated with the smart grid and
is provided by advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). This
infrastructure is vulnerable to cyberattacks that can manipulate
the guideline prices to shift the demand to periods of the Fig. 1:

                  is designed for a networked control system subject to
                  stochastic disturbances and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
                  Each subsystem
is constrained by actuator saturation and all of them are coupled via
                  probabilistic constraints. By using the information on
                  stochastic disturbances and considering the loss of data
                  packet resulting from DoS attacks explicitly, an observer is
                  designed to reconstruct the states and coupling probabilistic
                  constraints are transformed into coupled deterministic
                  constraints. By adopting the update strategy that only one
                  subsystem is optimized at each time step, while others are
                  setting feasible solutions as their control inputs, the
                  constraints are further transformed into local deterministic
                  constraints. To mitigate performance degradation due to DoS
                  attacks, a performance constraint is introduced such that the
                  optimal performance is not much worse than when the networks
                  work perfectly. Constraints satisfaction, recursive
                  feasibility and quadratic stability can be ensured despite the
                  presence of DoS attacks. A numerical simulation is given to
                  demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

                  the case in which some of the agents might perform one type of
                  adversarial actions (attacks) and they do not comply with the
                  decisions computed by performing a distributed MPC algorithm.
                  In this regard, these agents could obtain a better performance
                  at the cost of degrading the performance of the network as a
                  whole. A resilient distributed method that can deal with such
                  issues is proposed in this paper. The method consists of two
                  parts. The first part is to ensure that the decisions obtained
                  from the algorithm are robustly feasible against most of the
                  attacks with high confidence. In this part, we formulate the
                  economic dispatch problem, taking into account the attacks as
                  a chance-constrained problem, and employ a two-step
                  randomization-based approach to obtain a feasible solution
                  with a predefined level of confidence. The second part
                  consists in the identification and mitigation of the
                  adversarial agents, which utilizes hypothesis testing with
                  Bayesian inference and requires each agent to solve a
                  mixed-integer problem to decide the connections with its
                  neighbors. In addition, an analysis of the decisions computed
                  using the stochastic approach and the outcome of the
                  identification and mitigation method is provided. The
                  performance of the proposed approach is also shown through
                  numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Developing tools for attack identification in large-scale networked control systems is a research area of increasing significance for the secure and reliable operation of autonomous control systems. Due to scalability limits and privacy issues of individual subsystems, attack identification methods should not rely on global model knowledge. We address systems of interconnected nonlinear subsystems with coupled dynamics or constraints in a distributed control setup. The local controllers share information about the coupling variables of the subsystems and are designed to be robust towards attacks and uncertain influences through neighboring subsystems. We present a scalable hierarchical attack identification method which monitors the evolution of the coupling variables after an attack occurred in some unknown subsystem. Based on the mutual exchange of local sensitivity information among the subsystems, the propagation of the attack through the network is approximated. The propagation equations are used to formulate a quadratic program whose solution determines the attack signal that explains the observed network evolution best. The developed approach is applied to the IEEE 30 bus system to illustrate attack identification in power systems with faulty buses.},

  abstract = {Networked predictive control is an effective method to handle time delays and data dropouts in networked control systems, but it is difficult to apply the control strategy to networked multi-agent systems. First, the computational burden will increase exceedingly when the control strategy is applied to networked multi-agent systems. Second, restrictions have to be imposed on the communication topology to implement the control strategy; Third, most existing networked predictive controllers lack robustness to model uncertainties. In this paper, these problems are solved by introducing predicting error to the control scheme. The proposed control strategy not only guarantees consensus and stability of the overall system, but also reduces the computational burden exceedingly. In addition, the proposed algorithm is robust to model uncertainties. At last, the proposed control strategy can be executed in distributed processors, therefore, flexibility and robustness are preserved for the networked multi-agent systems. These features make the control strategy applicable in practice. Digital simulations and experiments based on spacecraft simulators are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

                  cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with intermittent communication
                  faults, where the faults may be caused by bad or broken
                  communication devices and/or cyber attackers. To solve them, a
                  watermark-based anomaly detector is proposed, where the faults
                  are divided to be either detectable or undetectable. Secondly,
                  the fault’s intermittent characteristic is described by the
                  average dwell-time (ADT)-like concept, and then the reliable
                  control issues, under the undetectable faults to the detector,
                  are converted into stabilization issues of switched systems.
                  Furthermore, based on the identifier-critic-structure learning
                  algorithm, a data-driven switched controller with a
                  prescribed-performance-based switching law is proposed, and by
                  the ADT approach, a tolerated fault set is given.
                  Additionally, it is shown that the presented switching laws
                  can improve the system performance degradation in asynchronous
                  intervals, where the degradation is caused by the
                  fault-maker-triggered switching rule, which is unknown for CPS
                  operators. Finally, an illustrative example validates the
                  proposed method.}

Distributed detection filters are designed using relative output information and local input information among agents to detect the actuator faults and sensor faults in agents, and H∞/H− formulation for this problem is presented in the finite frequency domain. In order to solve the complexity problems caused by multiple leaders in the system, the influence of leaders on the residual signals of followers is taken into account in the design of the proposed detection filter, and through the reasonable design of the controller, the containment control of the followers can also be achieved simultaneously. The controller and filter parameters are obtained by solving the optimization problem with linear matrix inequalities(LMI) constraints. Furthermore, faults are allowed to occur in leaders in this paper, and an effective algorithm is proposed to detect and isolate faults in the system. At last, an adjustable filter structure is proposed to prevent the followers from being influenced by the failure leader, which is of great practical significance. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a simulation study is provided.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the distributed consensus-based estimation and control of large-scale systems under gossip communication protocol. Novel observers which combine local Luenberger-like observers with consensus-based strategies are proposed. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions in the form of matrix inequalities are established such that the considered system is exponentially mean-square stable with a prescribed L2-gain. The observer and controller gains can be obtained efficiently by the proposed numerical algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by a numerical example.},

In the presence of denial-of-service attackers, effective signals sent by a transmitter are interfered with causing degradation of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and even packet loss. The effect of multiple attacks on the wireless networked control system is maximized by cooperative game. An H∞ minimax controller is also designed to guarantee an optimal performance for the wireless networked control system in the worst case.

  abstract   = {This paper investigates the stochastic scaled consensus problem for multi-agent systems with semi-Markov switching topologies. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the addressed system to realize the scaled consensus with probability one, which means that all agents’ states almost surely reach a dictated proportion. Here, the semi-Markov process concerned is much more general than those utilized in the recent literature, which can be characterized by two important factors: 1) the transition probability matrix, and 2) the polytropical distribution functions of sojourn times. In addition, pinning scaled consensus protocol is designed by employing the pinning control technique, where only the root nodes of the union set of all the topologies are chosen to be pinned, and the final desired state value of the considered system can be realized with probability one. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate validity of the obtained main results.},

  abstract = {We study a security problem for interconnected systems, where each subsystem aims to detect local attacks using local measurements and information exchanged with neighboring subsystems. The subsystems also wish to maintain the privacy of their states and, therefore, use privacy mechanisms that share limited or noisy information with other subsystems. We quantify the privacy level based on the estimation error of a subsystem’s state and propose a novel framework to compare different mechanisms based on their privacy guarantees. We develop a local attack detection scheme without assuming the knowledge of the global dynamics, which uses local and shared information to detect attacks with provable guarantees. Additionally, we quantify a trade-off between security and privacy of the local subsystems. Interestingly, we show that, for some instances of the attack, the subsystems can achieve a better detection performance by being more private. We provide an explanation for this counter-intuitive behavior and illustrate our results with examples.},

  abstract = {In privacy-preserving controller design, there is usually a trade-off between the privacy level and control performances, and we show in this paper that this trade-off in particular determines a lower bound on the differential privacy level of the closed-loop system. The control task we consider is reference tracking in a plug-and-play setting, and the plant under control is a networked system of modules, each of which has no access to the models of the others. For a module, we first identify the whole set of tracking local controllers based on the Youla parametrization. At the same time, each module, to protect its own privacy, tries to prevent the other interconnected modules to identify its private information; in this context, for example, the tracking reference signal (say, the target production amount if each module is a workshop in a factory) can be viewed as a piece of private information. Each module can tune the parameters of its local controller to increase the privacy level of its reference signal. However, if the distribution of Laplace (resp. uniform) noise is fixed, the differential privacy level of a Laplace (resp. uniform) mechanism cannot be further improved from a ceiling value no matter how one tunes parameters. In other words, for modular systems under local reference tracking control, there is a lower bound on the differential privacy level.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel mutual information (MI) matrix based method for fault detection. Given a m-dimensional fault process, the MI matrix is a m×m matrix in which the (i,j)-th entry measures the MI values between the i-th dimension and the j-th dimension variables. We introduce the recently proposed matrix-based Rényi’s α-entropy functional to estimate MI values in each entry of the MI matrix. The new estimator avoids density estimation and it operates on the eigenspectrum of a (normalized) symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which makes it well suited for industrial process. We combine different orders of statistics of the transformed components (TCs) extracted from the MI matrix to constitute the detection index, and derive a simple similarity index to monitor the changes of characteristics of the underlying process in consecutive windows. We term the overall methodology “projections of mutual information matrix” (PMIM). Experiments on both synthetic data and the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process demonstrate the interpretability of PMIM in identifying the root variables that cause the faults, and its superiority in detecting the occurrence of faults in terms of the improved fault detection rate (FDR) and the lowest false alarm rate (FAR). The advantages of PMIM is also less sensitive to hyper-parameters. The advantages of PMIM is also less sensitive to hyper-parameters. Code of PMIM is available at https://github.com/SJYuCNEL/Fault\_detection\_PMIM.},

Subsequently, we illustrate our framework with a set of examples, namely: i) how we can use it to compute the bribing resistance of each node in a network; ii) comparing our measure against metrics from the literature in measuring network bribing resistance; iii) how we may utilize the proposed framework to evaluate the bribing resistance of clusters/groups of nodes in large-scale networks.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new generalized attack separation scheme in energy internet to analyze how an attacker behaves. This scheme consists of a robust interval state estimation-based anomaly detection method and a coordinated bad data processor. We develop an anomaly detection method that takes system uncertainties, i.e., forecasting uncertainty and parameter perturbation, into account to approximate the largest possible deviations of state variables in smart grid, thus recognizing stealthy anomalies. In this method, we decouple the power balancing formulation into P-θ and Q-V sub-problems to improve the computational efficiency. Thereafter, a new coordinated bad data processor is proposed to automatically filter out the impact of malicious attacks on state estimation and to reconstruct the real states of a cyber physical smart grid. In this processor, three-stage state estimator is applied to rapidly assess the biased state from the current observations with the contamination of meters and communication channels. As a result, the implemented attack vector can be separated and isolated from the current observations online. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated via comprehensive tests on several IEEE systems. The obtained results show the strong robustness, high stability and promising performance for attack separation, indicating a high potential of the proposed scheme for practical implementations in deep-cyber penetrated smart grids.},
