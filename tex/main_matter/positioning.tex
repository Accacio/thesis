\chapter{Where does this work stand?}\label{sec:positioning}
% \epigraph{}
% {\textit{~}\\\textsc{}}
As we have seen in the last chapters, there are many choices a designer have to make before designing a \cps{} and decomposing the \mpc{}.
And if we are interested in security, some more thinking must be put into it.

In this chapter we try to recapitulate the choices made for this work, mentioned in the course of the chapters.
The idea of this chapter is to concentrate them all in one place so a reader can have a better global vision, and know more or less what to expect (or not) from the next chapters.

We divide this chapter into two sections.
The first for the choices regarding the design of the control of the system.
And the second one for the choices for the security.
In this latter section, we compare this thesis with the most adjacent works, already presented in Chapter~\ref{sec:anomalous}.

\section{Control design}
\subsection{Control}\label{sec:control_chosen}
We model the system as a \textbf{\ltidt{} system} with \textbf{linear input constraints}, and we choose to control it using \textbf{\mpc{}}.
The objective function used is \textbf{quadratic}, which by consequence produces a \mpc{} that solves a \textbf{\qp{} problem}.
However, we suppose the problem may have an impact on the calculation if we try to solve it in a monolithic form. We need to \textbf{decompose} it.

\subsection{Decomposition}\label{sec:decomposition_chosen}
We choose to use the \textbf{optimization decomposition framework}, shown in~\cite{ConejoEtAl2006,BoydEtAl2015}.
We suppose the system is \textbf{decomposable} into \textbf{sub-systems} and our original problem is decomposable into \textbf{sub-problems}.

Using the framework, we see the input constraints \textbf{couple} the sub-systems, and as a consequence the sub-problems.
The system is decomposed using the configuration for \textbf{complicating constraints}. Finally, we choose to use a decomposition called \textbf{primal decomposition}, detailed in the next chapter, which needs \textbf{coordination} to find the optimal solution.

\subsection{Topology}\label{sec:decomposition_chosen}
The first choice for the topology of the system was to assume \textbf{correspondence} between sub-systems and sub-problems.

The agents were supposed to form a \textbf{connected} graph, in which the agents can communicate to coordinate the decomposition (\textbf{coordinated control}).
For some security/trust reasons we choose to use an \textbf{hierarchical} topology, where we \emph{entrust} an agent the role of \textbf{referee}, coordinating the exchanges between other agents.

We suppose the communication is \textbf{bidirectional}, where the agents can communicate with the \textbf{referee} and vice-versa.
We also suppose the agents communicate \textbf{synchronously}, so we don't have delays on the communication.

\section{Security}
For the security, we use~\cite{VelardeEtAl2017b,ChanfreutEtAl2018} as inspiration to demonstrate the \textbf{vulnerabilities of the primal decomposition} method, which was never presented.

As the other most adjacent works, we are only interested in \textbf{inter-agent attacks} of the \textbf{\fdi{}} type, whose exact model is presented in the next chapter.

In~\cite{VelardeEtAl2017a,VelardeEtAl2017b,VelardeEtAl2018}, the authors present robust methods based on graph theory, where the attacker is not detected per se, but suspect agents are disconnected or ignored somehow.

We opt however, as in~\cite{AnandutaEtAl2018,AnandutaEtAl2019,AnandutaEtAl2020},
for an \textbf{active} \textbf{resilient} approach.
The strategy is precisely detailed in the next chapters, but for the detection we use an \textbf{active} method, where we add some data to detect the attacker.
We use a \textbf{hybrid} of \textbf{analytical knowledge} of the decomposition and \textbf{learning methods} create the detector.
For the recovery, we use the same \textbf{analytical knowledge} used for the detection to reconstruct some variables and compensate disturbances.

Duo to the reduced number of adjacent works, we can compile and compare them in a tabular manner.
In Tab.~\ref{tab:compare_works} we compare them with the methods presented in this thesis.
