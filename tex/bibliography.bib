                  propose a dual method which decouples the difficulties
                  relative to the functionals f and g from the possible
                  ill-conditioning effects of the linear operator A. The
                  approach is based on the use of an Augmented Lagrangian
                  functional and leads to an efficient and simply implementable
                  algorithm. We study also the finite element approximation of
                  such problems, compatible with the use of our algorithm. The

                  like the quadratic dynamic matrix control, lies in the fact
                  that they can handle hard constraints on the inputs

                  provides a theoretical framework within which the stability
                  and performance properties of such algorithms can be studied.

                  determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which
                  minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the
                  control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the
                  finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the
                  usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic
                  regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to
                  the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise
                  linear function. By computing the inherent underlying
                  controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the
                  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for discrete-time linear
                  constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has
                  long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained
                  systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive
                  for a wide range of practical problems where the computational
                  complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also

                  the effect of perturbations on the inverse of a square matrix.
                  First, it assumes that the perturbation is infinitesimally
                  small. Second, it does not take into account the perturbation
                  structure (e.g., Vandermonde). Similarly, the classical notion
                  of the inverse of a matrix neglects the possibility of large,
                  structured perturbations. We define a new quantity, the
                  structured maximal inversion error, that takes into account
                  both structure and non-necessarily small perturbation size.
                  When the perturbation is infinitesimal, we obtain a
                  "structured condition number". We introduce the notion of
                  approximate inverse, as a matrix that best approximates the
                  inverse of a matrix with structured perturbations, when the
                  perturbation varies in a given range. For a wide class of
                  perturbation structures, we show how to use (convex)
                  semidefinite programming to compute bounds on the structured
                  maximal inversion error and structured condition number, and
                  compute an approximate inverse. The results are exact when the
                  perturbation is "unstructured"-we then obtain an analytic
                  expression for the approximate inverse. When the perturbation
                  is unstructured and additive, we recover the classical
                  condition number; the approximate inverse is the operator
                  related to the Total Least Squares (orthogonal regression)
                  problem.},

                  problem of segmenting an unknown number of subspaces of
                  unknown and varying dimensions from sample data points. We
                  represent the subspaces with a set of homogeneous polynomials
                  whose degree is the number of subspaces and whose derivatives
                  at a data point give normal vectors to the subspace passing
                  through the point. When the number of subspaces is known, we
                  show that these polynomials can be estimated linearly from
                  data; hence, subspace segmentation is reduced to classifying
                  one point per subspace. We select these points optimally from
                  the data set by minimizing certain distance function, thus
                  dealing automatically with moderate noise in the data. A basis
                  for the complement of each subspace is then recovered by
                  applying standard PCA to the collection of derivatives (normal
                  vectors). Extensions of GPCA that deal with data in a

                  for parallel processors, distributed coordination of mobile
                  autonomous agents, and network synchronization. In this model,
                  each node updates its local variable with a weighted average
                  of its neighbors' values, and each new value is corrupted by
                  an additive noise with zero mean. The quality of consensus can
                  be measured by the total mean-square deviation of the
                  individual variables from their average, which converges to a
                  steady-state value. We consider the problem of finding the

                  the mean-square deviations obtained by this method and several

  title     = {Parameter Estimation for Mechanical Systems Using an Extended Kalman Filter},
  year      = {2008},
  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new computational approach based on
                  the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in order to apply the
                  polynomial chaos theory to the problem of parameter
                  estimation, using direct stochastic collocation. The Kalman
                  filter formula is used at each time step in order to update
                  the polynomial chaos of the uncertain states and the uncertain
                  parameters. The main advantage of this method is that the
                  estimation comes in the form of a probability density function
                  rather than a deterministic value, combined with the fact that
                  simulations using polynomial chaos methods are much faster
                  than Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed method is applied
                  to a nonlinear four degree of freedom roll plane model of a
                  vehicle, in which an uncertain mass with an uncertain position
                  is added on the roll bar. A major drawback was identified: the
                  EKF can diverge when using a high sampling frequency, which
                  might prevent the use of enough data to obtain accurate
                  results when a low sampling frequency is necessary. When
                  applying the polynomial chaos theory to the EKF, numerical
                  errors can accumulate even faster than in the general case due
                  to the truncation in the polynomial chaos expansions, which is
                  illustrated on a simple example. An alternative EKF approach
                  which consists of applying the filter formula on all the
                  observations at once usually yields better results, but can
                  still sometimes fail to produce very accurate results.
                  Therefore, using different sampling rates in order to verify
                  the coherence of the results and comparing the results to a
                  different approach is strongly recommended.},

  abstract  = {A power grid is a complex system connecting electric power
                  generators to consumers through power transmission and
                  distribution networks across a large geographical area. System
                  monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of
                  power grids, and state estimation is used in system monitoring
                  to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of
                  meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques
                  have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements,
                  including the interacting bad measurements introduced by
                  arbitrary, non-random causes. At first glance, it seems that
                  these techniques can also defeat malicious measurements
                  injected by attackers.In this paper, we present a new class of
                  attacks, called false data injection attacks, against state
                  estimation in electric power grids. We show that an attacker
                  can exploit the configuration of a power system to launch such
                  attacks to successfully introduce arbitrary errors into
                  certain state variables while bypassing existing techniques
                  for bad measurement detection. Moreover, we look at two
                  realistic attack scenarios, in which the attacker is either
                  constrained to some specific meters (due to the physical
                  protection of the meters), or limited in the resources
                  required to compromise meters. We show that the attacker can
                  systematically and efficiently construct attack vectors in
                  both scenarios, which can not only change the results of state
                  estimation, but also modify the results in arbitrary ways. We
                  demonstrate the success of these attacks through simulation
                  using IEEE test systems. Our results indicate that security
                  protection of the electric power grid must be revisited when
                  there are potentially malicious attacks.},

                  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems which
                  monitor and control the modern day irrigation canal systems.
                  This type of monitoring and control infrastructure is also
                  common for many other water distribution systems. We present a
                  linearized shallow water partial differential equation (PDE)
                  system that can model water flow in a network of canal pools
                  which are equipped with lateral offtakes for water withdrawal
                  and are connected by automated gates. The knowledge of the
                  system dynamics enables us to develop a deception attack
                  scheme based on switching the PDE parameters and proportional
                  (P) boundary control actions, to withdraw water from the pools
                  through offtakes. We briefly discuss the limits on
                  detectability of such attacks. We use a known formulation
                  based on low frequency approximation of the PDE model and an
                  associated proportional integral (PI) controller, to create a
                  stealthy deception scheme capable of compromising the
                  performance of the closed-loop system. We test the proposed
                  attack scheme in simulation, using a shallow water solver; and
                  show that the attack is indeed realizable in practice by
                  implementing it on a physical canal in Southern France: the
                  Gignac canal. A successful field experiment shows that the
                  attack scheme enables us to steal water stealthily from the
                  canal until the end of the attack.},

                  independent dynamics but coupled objectives and hard
                  constraints. The overall goal is to develop a distributed
                  approach that solves small subproblems while minimizing a
                  fleet-level objective. In the new algorithm, vehicles solve
                  their subproblems in sequence while generating feasible
                  modifications to the prediction of other vehicles' plans. In
                  order to avoid reproducing the global optimization, the
                  decisions of other vehicles are parameterized using a much
                  smaller number of variables than in the centralized
                  formulation. This reduced number of variables is sufficient to
                  improve the cooperation between vehicles without significantly
                  increasing the computational effort involved. The resulting
                  algorithm is shown to be robustly feasible under the action of
                  unknown but bounded disturbances. Furthermore, the fleet
                  objective function is proven to monotonically decrease as the
                  algorithm cycles through the vehicles in the fleet and over
                  the time. The results from simulations and a hardware
                  experiment demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve
                  the fleet objective by temporarily having one vehicle
                  sacrifice its individual objective, showing the cooperative
                  behavior.},

In this paper we consider the control of several subsystems coupled through the inputs by a set of independent agents that are able to communicate. We assume that each agent has access only to the model and the state of one of the subsystems. This implies that in order to take a cooperative decision, the agents must negotiate. At each sampling time agents make proposals to improve an initial feasible solution on behalf of their local cost function, state and model. These proposals are accepted if the global cost improves the cost corresponding to the current solution. In addition, we provide conditions that guarantee that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable along with an optimization based design procedure that is based on the full model of the system. Finally, the proposed scheme is put to test through simulation.},

We assume that each agent only has partial information of the model and the state of the system. In the proposed scheme, the agents communicate twice each sampling time in order to share enough information to take a cooperative decision. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee practical stability of the closed-loop system as well as an optimization-based procedure to design the controller so that these conditions are satisfied. The theoretical results and the design procedure are illustrated using two different examples. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

                  control (DMPC) algorithm based on Benders' decomposition for
                  temperature regulation in buildings using multiple heating
                  sources. It is well known that the main objective of this
                  control problem is to minimize the heating energy bills while
                  maintaining a certain indoor thermal comfort. To reduce the
                  heating costs, many buildings are equipped with different
                  heating sources. An example is the use of a hot water based
                  central heating system and local electric convectors as
                  complementary heating sources. Using a linear system model of
                  the controlled process, the MPC optimization problem can be
                  solved by linear programming. In order to reduce the
                  computational demand required to solve the minimization
                  problem, the authors propose a DMPC algorithm based on the
                  Benders' decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed
                  approach compared to the currently used PI-based control is
                  illustrated in a simulation study.},

  abstract        = {In reality, a system is almost nonlinear. To estimate the
                  parameter or state of this system, nonlinear approach is
                  needed. The Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) and the Unscented
                  Kalman Filter(UKF) are used to estimate this nonlinear
                  problem. EKF uses first order Taylor expansion to approximate
                  the nonlinear system, while UKF performs a stochastic
                  linearization by using a weighted statistical linear
                  regression process. The purpose of this paper is to estimate
                  the state of the nonlinear suspension system based on the
                  Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter. The
                  simulation deals with state estimation of nonlinear suspension
                  system by using these filters and is compared with the true
                  state. Also LQR controller and output feedback PD controller
                  will be designed by aid of UKF and EKF estimation. Simulation
                  results show that two nonlinear Kalman filters are effective
                  in estimating the state of a nonlinear suspension system.},

                  plant-controller systems, when their security is
                  interdependent due to network induced risks. Each plant is
                  modeled by a discrete-time stochastic linear system, with the
                  systems controlled over a shared communication network. We
                  formulate the problem of security choices of the individual
                  system operators (also called players) as a non-cooperative
                  game. We consider a two-stage game, in which on the first
                  stage the players decide whether to invest in security or not;
                  and on the second stage, they apply control inputs to minimize
                  the average operational costs. We characterize the equilibria
                  of the game, which includes the determination of the
                  individually optimal security levels. Next, we solve the
                  problem of finding the socially optimal security levels. The
                  presence of interdependent security causes a negative
                  externality, and the individual players tend to under invest
                  in security relative to the social optimum. This leads to a
                  gap between the individual and the socially optimal security
                  levels for a wide range of security costs. From our results,
                  regulatory impositions to incentivize higher security
                  investments are desirable.},

                  The multi-agent controller is implemented using an open source
                  agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework
                  (JADE). Simulation is carried out in Matlab environment.
                  MACsimJX is used to interface the Simulink model with Multi

                  O(1k). The performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated
                  on randomly generated optimization problems arising in
                  distributed model predictive control (DMPC). The evaluation
                  shows that, when the problem data is sparse and large-scale,

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of resilient in-network
                  consensus in the presence of misbehaving nodes. Secure and
                  fault-tolerant consensus algorithms typically assume knowledge
                  of nonlocal information; however, this assumption is not
                  suitable for large-scale dynamic networks. To remedy this, we
                  focus on local strategies that provide resilience to faults
                  and compromised nodes. We design a consensus protocol based on
                  local information that is resilient to worst-case security
                  breaches, assuming the compromised nodes have full knowledge
                  of the network and the intentions of the other nodes. We
                  provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the normal
                  nodes to reach asymptotic consensus despite the influence of
                  the misbehaving nodes under different threat assumptions. We
                  show that traditional metrics such as connectivity are not
                  adequate to characterize the behavior of such algorithms, and
                  develop a novel graph-theoretic property referred to as
                  network robustness. Network robustness formalizes the notion
                  of redundancy of direct information exchange between subsets
                  of nodes in the network, and is a fundamental property for
                  analyzing the behavior of certain distributed algorithms that
                  use only local information.},

                  systems (MAS) for the typical rural Indian microgrid. The

                  emergent data arising from the interaction of the various
                  agent entities within the microgrid. Individual agents and
                  their functions are mapped with operations that are
                  custom-framed for the rural Indian microgrid scenario. The
                  framework developed for the modeling of a single microgrid MAS
                  allows for effective control and better operation. The agents
                  designed in this microgrid typically fall into one of the
                  three broad categories of DG agents, Mu agents and D agents.
                  In the rural Indian context, the Load agent, the Grid Agent,
                  the DER agent and the Storage agent are typically DG agents.

                  dynamics control, and a high-level trajectory tracking with a

                  control along with feedback linearisation to obtain a linear
                  system of relative degree three that models force controlled

                  wide class of convex and robust distributed optimization
                  problems in peer-to-peer networks. In this setup, convex
                  constraint sets are distributed to the network processors who
                  have to compute the optimizer of a linear cost function
                  subject to the constraints. We propose a novel fully
                  distributed and asynchronous algorithm, named cutting-plane
                  consensus, to solve the problem, based on a polyhedral outer
                  approximation of the constraint sets. Processors running the
                  algorithm compute and exchange linear approximations of their
                  locally feasible sets. Independently of the number of
                  processors in the network, each processor stores only a small
                  number of linear constraints, making the algorithm scalable to
                  large networks. The cutting-plane consensus algorithm is
                  presented and analyzed for the general framework.

                  show its robustness against communication or processor

                  specified to three different classes of distributed
                  optimization problems, namely 1) inequality constrained
                  problems, 2) robust optimization problems, and 3) almost

                  results. That is, we show how to solve: position estimation in

                  widely used advanced control technique, which is model-based
                  and capable of handling both input and state/output
                  constraints via receding horizon optimization methods.
                  Fundamentally, MPC is a nondynamic or memoryless state
                  feedback control. Because of its use of a model, MPC should be
                  amenable to adaptive implementation and to on-line tuning of
                  the model. Such an approach requires guaranteeing signal
                  properties, known as 'persistent excitation', to ensure
                  uniform identifiability of the model, often expressed in terms
                  of spectral content or 'sufficient richness' of a periodic
                  input. We propose an approach to augment the input constraint
                  set of MPC to provide this guarantee. This, in turn, requires

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to address the decentralized fault tolerant model predictive control of discrete-time interconnected nonlinear systems. The overall system is composed of a number of discrete-time interconnected nonlinear subsystems at the presence of multiple faults occurring at unknown time-instants. In order to deal with the unknown interconnection effects and changes in model dynamics due to multiple faults, both passive and active fault tolerant control design are considered. In the Active fault tolerant case an online approximation algorithm is applied to estimate the unknown interconnection effects and changes in model dynamics due to multiple faults. Besides, the decentralized control strategy is implemented for each subsystem with the model predictive control algorithm subject to some constraints. It is showed that the proposed method guarantees input-to-state stability characterization for both local subsystems and the global system under some predetermined assumptions. The simulation results are exploited to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.},

                  filters for detection and isolation of faults applied to the
                  buses within the group. The scheme is distributed in the sense
                  that it uses only locally available data such as the generated
                  power, loads, and power flows. Specifically, a fault detection
                  method based on a geometric approach is applied to two
                  different settings. Depending on the availability of phasor

                  energy, doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) play an
                  increasingly essential role in the power industry. It has been
                  well recognized that modeling and monitoring the dynamic
                  behavior of DFIGs are important to ensure power system
                  reliability. Real-time estimation of the dynamic states of a
                  DFIG is possible with high-speed measurements. But how to use
                  such measurements to have high-quality estimation remains to
                  be a challenge. Estimating dynamic states relies on a good
                  dynamic model of the DFIG. Building a high-fidelity model is a
                  problem in tandem with the dynamic state estimation problem.
                  In this paper, we propose an ensemble Kalman filter
                  (EnKF)-based method for the state estimation and parameter
                  calibration of a DFIG. The mathematical formulation of state
                  estimation combining with parameter estimation is presented.
                  Simulation cases were studied to demonstrate the accuracy of
                  both dynamic state estimation and parameter estimation.
                  Sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the
                  measurement noise, initial state errors and parameter errors.
                  The results indicate this EnKF-based method has a robust
                  performance on the state estimation and parameter calibration
                  of a DFIG.},

  abstract        = {SUMMARYThe operation of urban traffic networks with
                  distributed model predictive control (DMPC) can be more
                  flexible than centralized strategies because DMPC allows for
                  graceful expansion of the control infrastructure, localized
                  reconfiguration, and tolerance to faulty operation. Yet,
                  computational performance is less efficient than with
                  centralized model predictive control (MPC) because of the
                  added complexity brought about by distribution schemes. To
                  assess the trade-off between flexibility and performance, in
                  this paper we assess the tolerance to failure and performance
                  of DMPC in contrast with centralized control. The problem of
                  concern is the signal setting of green time in a
                  representative traffic network modeled in a commercial
                  microscopic traffic simulator. A software tool is developed
                  for implementing and simulating the DMPC framework in tandem
                  with the simulator. Comparisons of DMPC with MPC and a
                  baseline feedback control strategy that does not use
                  constrained optimization show that DMPC can achieve
                  performance gains with respect to the baseline case and
                  enhance tolerance to failure. Computations for DMPC are less
                  efficient than with centralized MPC; nevertheless, the time
                  taken by DMPC is well below the required for field use.
                  Although the true distributed deployment of DMPC requires
                  special hardware, its implementation in a central cluster can
                  be made without loss of operational flexibility. Copyright ©

  abstract = {Urban energy management nowadays has put more focus on
                  residential houses energy consumption. Lots of machine
                  learning based data-driven approaches have the abilities to
                  characterize and forecast total energy consumption of
                  commercial data. However, a paucity of research applying
                  data-driven methods have been tested on the hour ahead energy
                  consumption forecast for typical single family houses in the
                  US. With the advances in smart metering, sub meter usages
                  forecast in household-level is also getting more and more
                  popular on smart building control and demand response program.
                  The situation here inspires us to develop a hybrid model to
                  address the problem of residential hour and day ahead load
                  forecasting through the integration of data-driven techniques
                  with a physics-based model. In this article, we report on the
                  evaluations of five different machine learning algorithms,
                  artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression
                  (SVR), least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM), Gaussian
                  process regression (GPR) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM),
                  applied to four residential data set that contains smart
                  meters. Both total and non-air conditioning (AC) power
                  consumption are forecasted for hour ahead and 24-h ahead. The
                  variation of patterns captured from non-AC part is further
                  input as internal heat gain to a physics-based model. The
                  model uses a 2R-1C thermal network and an AC regression model.
                  By utilizing this hybrid approach, we get AC load prediction
                  and non-AC energy forecast simultaneously. Total energy
                  consumption is further produced by summing up the two sub
                  meters forecast for hybrid model. The results from new
                  modeling are compared with those from pure data-driven
                  techniques. The final result showing improvements of
                  coefficient of variance between the best data-driven model and
                  hybrid model are 6-10 \% and 2-15 \% for hour ahead and 24-h
                  ahead, respectively.},

                  be operated in parallel with the conventional grid or isolated
                  mode, is one of the key enabling components of a smart grid.
                  The dynamics of the system, due to the penetration of highly
                  intermittent and unpredictable distributed energy resources
                  changes. Thus, the control strategies become difficult and for
                  improving the performance of the existing system an advanced
                  energy management is required. The microgrid energy management
                  should be capable of balancing supply and demand at every

                  vulnerability of a distributed model predictive control
                  scheme. A distributed system can be easily attacked by a
                  malicious agent that modifies the reliable information
                  exchange. We consider different types of so-called insider
                  attacks. In particular, we analyze a controller that is part
                  of the control architecture that sends false information to
                  others to manipulate costs for its own advantage. We propose a
                  mechanism to protect or, at least, relieve the consequences of
                  the attack in a typical distributed model predictive control
                  negotiation procedure. More specifically, a consensus approach
                  that dismisses the extreme control actions is presented as a
                  way to protect the distributed system from potential threats.
                  Two applications are considered as case studies, ie, an
                  academic example involving the control of a distributed system
                  with a single coupled input and a distributed local
                  electricity grid of households. The results are presented via
                  simulations to illustrate both the consequences of the attacks
                  and the defense mechanisms.},

                  security control and attack detection of industrial CPSs.
                  First, the typical system modeling on CPSs is summarized to
                  cater for the requirement of the performance analysis. Then
                  three typical types of cyber-attacks, i.e. denial-of-service
                  attacks, replay attacks, and deception attacks, are disclosed
                  from an engineering perspective. Moreover, robustness,
                  security and resilience as well as stability are discussed to
                  govern the capability of weakening various attacks. The
                  development on attack detection for industrial CPSs is
                  reviewed according to the categories on detection approaches.
                  Furthermore, the security control and state estimation are
                  discussed in detail. Finally, some challenge issues are raised
                  for the future research.},

In particular this first paper focuses on the mechanisms of group regulation in social systems. It will be noted that there are major differences between the way in which DMPC algorithms and Social Human Participants (SHPs) form decisions. DMPC can make optimal decisions but these are only optimal with respect to a given objective and model, both of which must be explicit. SHPs operate, by and large, with only vague, implicit objectives and models – which can be surprisingly accurate – but often make sub-optimal decisions both individually (because of irrationality or poor anticipation and due to a short horizon, bad model or misjudgement of objectives) and in a group sense (for the previous reasons plus selfishness). Thus while SHPs’ decisions would typically be suboptimal, with respect to their desired goals, for the aforementioned reasons, it can be expected that SHPs’ decision making would evolve towards an optimal solution as groups of SHPs develop more experience within the system they’re operating in.},

                  systems plays an important role in safe operation of

                  rigorous and computationally tractable framework for
                  stabilizing model predictive control with online parameter
                  estimation to improve performance and reduce conservatism.
                  Requirements for closed-loop stability and provable constraint
                  satisfaction are considered separately, resulting in the use
                  of online set-membership system identification combined with
                  homothetic prediction tubes for robust constraint
                  satisfaction, and an $H_{\infty}$ optimal point estimate of
                  the unknown parameters to achieve a finite closed-loop gain
                  from the disturbance to the state. Extensions to time-varying
                  parameters and persistently exciting inputs to guarantee

                  controller is designed for a networked control system subject
                  to stochastic disturbances and denial-of-service (DoS)
                  attacks. Each subsystem is constrained by actuator saturation
                  and all of them are coupled via probabilistic constraints. By
                  using the information on stochastic disturbances and
                  considering the loss of data packet resulting from DoS attacks
                  explicitly, an observer is designed to reconstruct the states
                  and coupling probabilistic constraints are transformed into
                  coupled deterministic constraints. By adopting the update
                  strategy that only one subsystem is optimized at each time
                  step, while others are setting feasible solutions as their
                  control inputs, the constraints are further transformed into
                  local deterministic constraints. To mitigate performance
                  degradation due to DoS attacks, a performance constraint is
                  introduced such that the optimal performance is not much worse
                  than when the networks work perfectly. Constraints
                  satisfaction, recursive feasibility and quadratic stability
                  can be ensured despite the presence of DoS attacks. A

  abstract   = {Summary Distributed energy management of interconnected
                  microgrids that is based on model predictive control (MPC)
                  relies on the cooperation of all agents (microgrids). This
                  paper discusses the case in which some of the agents might
                  perform one type of adversarial actions (attacks) and they do
                  not comply with the decisions computed by performing a
                  distributed MPC algorithm. In this regard, these agents could
                  obtain a better performance at the cost of degrading the
                  performance of the network as a whole. A resilient distributed
                  method that can deal with such issues is proposed in this
                  paper. The method consists of two parts. The first part is to
                  ensure that the decisions obtained from the algorithm are
                  robustly feasible against most of the attacks with high
                  confidence. In this part, we formulate the economic dispatch
                  problem, taking into account the attacks as a
                  chance-constrained problem, and employ a two-step
                  randomization-based approach to obtain a feasible solution
                  with a predefined level of confidence. The second part
                  consists in the identification and mitigation of the
                  adversarial agents, which utilizes hypothesis testing with
                  Bayesian inference and requires each agent to solve a
                  mixed-integer problem to decide the connections with its
                  neighbors. In addition, an analysis of the decisions computed
                  using the stochastic approach and the outcome of the
                  identification and mitigation method is provided. The
                  performance of the proposed approach is also shown through
                  numerical simulations.},

                  networked control systems is a research area of increasing
                  significance for the secure and reliable operation of
                  autonomous control systems. Due to scalability limits and
                  privacy issues of individual subsystems, attack identification
                  methods should not rely on global model knowledge. We address
                  systems of interconnected nonlinear subsystems with coupled
                  dynamics or constraints in a distributed control setup. The
                  local controllers share information about the coupling
                  variables of the subsystems and are designed to be robust
                  towards attacks and uncertain influences through neighboring
                  subsystems. We present a scalable hierarchical attack
                  identification method which monitors the evolution of the
                  coupling variables after an attack occurred in some unknown
                  subsystem. Based on the mutual exchange of local sensitivity
                  information among the subsystems, the propagation of the
                  attack through the network is approximated. The propagation
                  equations are used to formulate a quadratic program whose
                  solution determines the attack signal that explains the
                  observed network evolution best. The developed approach is
                  applied to the IEEE 30 bus system to illustrate attack
                  identification in power systems with faulty buses.},

  abstract = {Networked predictive control is an effective method to
                  handle time delays and data dropouts in networked control
                  systems, but it is difficult to apply the control strategy to
                  networked multi-agent systems. First, the computational burden
                  will increase exceedingly when the control strategy is applied
                  to networked multi-agent systems. Second, restrictions have to
                  be imposed on the communication topology to implement the
                  control strategy; Third, most existing networked predictive
                  controllers lack robustness to model uncertainties. In this
                  paper, these problems are solved by introducing predicting
                  error to the control scheme. The proposed control strategy not
                  only guarantees consensus and stability of the overall system,
                  but also reduces the computational burden exceedingly. In
                  addition, the proposed algorithm is robust to model
                  uncertainties. At last, the proposed control strategy can be
                  executed in distributed processors, therefore, flexibility and
                  robustness are preserved for the networked multi-agent
                  systems. These features make the control strategy applicable
                  in practice. Digital simulations and experiments based on
                  spacecraft simulators are carried out to verify the
                  effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

                  data-driven cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with intermittent
                  communication faults, where the faults may be caused by bad or
                  broken communication devices and/or cyber attackers. To solve
                  them, a watermark-based anomaly detector is proposed, where
                  the faults are divided to be either detectable or
                  undetectable. Secondly, the fault's intermittent
                  characteristic is described by the average dwell-time
                  (ADT)-like concept, and then the reliable control issues,
                  under the undetectable faults to the detector, are converted
                  into stabilization issues of switched systems. Furthermore,
                  based on the identifier-critic-structure learning algorithm, a
                  data-driven switched controller with a
                  prescribed-performance-based switching law is proposed, and by
                  the ADT approach, a tolerated fault set is given.
                  Additionally, it is shown that the presented switching laws
                  can improve the system performance degradation in asynchronous
                  intervals, where the degradation is caused by the
                  fault-maker-triggered switching rule, which is unknown for CPS

                  control of linear continuous-time multi-agent systems with
                  multi-leaders is firstly addressed in this paper. Distributed
                  detection filters are designed using relative output
                  information and local input information among agents to detect
                  the actuator faults and sensor faults in agents, and
                  $H_{\infty}$/H- formulation for this problem is presented in
                  the finite frequency domain. In order to solve the complexity
                  problems caused by multiple leaders in the system, the
                  influence of leaders on the residual signals of followers is
                  taken into account in the design of the proposed detection
                  filter, and through the reasonable design of the controller,
                  the containment control of the followers can also be achieved
                  simultaneously. The controller and filter parameters are
                  obtained by solving the optimization problem with linear
                  matrix inequalities(LMI) constraints. Furthermore, faults are
                  allowed to occur in leaders in this paper, and an effective
                  algorithm is proposed to detect and isolate faults in the
                  system. At last, an adjustable filter structure is proposed to
                  prevent the followers from being influenced by the failure
                  leader, which is of great practical significance. Finally, to
                  illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a
                  simulation study is provided.},

                  additive disturbances and state and control constraints, a
                  robust model predictive control (MPC) algorithm incorporating
                  online model adaptation is proposed. Sets of model parameters
                  are identified online and employed in a robust tube MPC
                  strategy with a nominal cost. The algorithm is shown to be
                  recursively feasible and input-to-state stable. Computational
                  tractability is ensured by using polytopic sets of fixed
                  complexity to bound parameter sets and predicted states.
                  Convex conditions for persistence of excitation are derived
                  and are related to probabilistic rates of convergence and
                  asymptotic bounds on parameter set estimates. We discuss how
                  to balance conflicting requirements on control signals for
                  achieving good tracking performance and parameter set estimate
                  accuracy. Conditions for convergence of the estimated
                  parameter set are discussed for the case of fixed complexity
                  parameter set estimates, inexact disturbance bounds, and noisy

                  dropouts are studied. For the discrete-time MASs under
                  identical packet dropouts, we present the expectation of the
                  total sojourn time of packet dropouts and successful message
                  transmission, the switching number from packet dropouts to
                  successful message transmission, and the awaken number of
                  packet dropouts and successful message transmission. Based on
                  these expectations, a linear consensus controller is designed
                  through analyzing the transient properties of the Markov
                  process such that the MASs can reach consensus almost surely
                  for any initial distribution of packet dropouts. When it comes
                  to the nonidentical packet dropouts where all the packets are
                  independent and stochastic, a Markovian-lossy-channel based
                  switching model (MLCBS model) is proposed. Based on the MLCBS
                  model, we also propose an easy-to-implement linear consensus
                  controller such that the MASs with nonidentical packet
                  dropouts can achieve consensus almost surely. Finally, the
                  theoretical results are illustrated by simulation examples.},

                  designing the distributed controller, and the unknown thermal
                  disturbances are incorporated by the robust optimization

                  subsystems. The subsystems also wish to maintain the privacy
                  of their states and, therefore, use privacy mechanisms that
                  share limited or noisy information with other subsystems. We
                  quantify the privacy level based on the estimation error of a

                  Additionally, we quantify a trade-off between security and

                  trade-off between the privacy level and control performances,
                  and we show in this paper that this trade-off in particular
                  determines a lower bound on the differential privacy level of
                  the closed-loop system. The control task we consider is
                  reference tracking in a plug-and-play setting, and the plant
                  under control is a networked system of modules, each of which
                  has no access to the models of the others. For a module, we
                  first identify the whole set of tracking local controllers
                  based on the Youla parametrization. At the same time, each
                  module, to protect its own privacy, tries to prevent the other
                  interconnected modules to identify its private information; in
                  this context, for example, the tracking reference signal (say,
                  the target production amount if each module is a workshop in a
                  factory) can be viewed as a piece of private information. Each
                  module can tune the parameters of its local controller to
                  increase the privacy level of its reference signal. However,
                  if the distribution of Laplace (resp. uniform) noise is fixed,
                  the differential privacy level of a Laplace (resp. uniform)
                  mechanism cannot be further improved from a ceiling value no
                  matter how one tunes parameters. In other words, for modular
                  systems under local reference tracking control, there is a
                  lower bound on the differential privacy level.},

                  framework for systems with high state-space dimensionality.
                  This work is motivated by the need to exploit sensor data that
                  appears in the form of images (e.g., 2D or 3D spatial fields
                  captured by thermal cameras). We propose to use dynamic mode
                  decomposition (DMD) to directly build a low-dimensional model
                  from image data and we use such model to obtain a tractable
                  MPC controller. We demonstrate the scalability of this
                  approach (which we call DMD-MPC) by using a 2D thermal
                  diffusion system. Here, we assume that the evolution of the
                  thermal field is captured by 50 x 50 pixel images, which
                  results in a 2500-dimensional state-space. We show that the
                  dynamics of this high-dimensional space can be accurately
                  captured by using a 40-dimensional DMD model and we show that
                  the field can be manipulated satisfactorily by using an MPC
                  controller that embeds the low-dimensional DMD model. We also
                  show that the DMD-MPC controller outperforms a standard MPC
                  controller that uses data collected from a finite set of
                  spatial locations (proxy locations) to manipulate the
                  high-dimensional thermal field. This illustrates the value of

                  based method for fault detection. Given a m-dimensional fault
                  process, the MI matrix is a m$\times$m matrix in which the
                  (i,j)-th entry measures the MI values between the i-th
                  dimension and the j-th dimension variables. We introduce the
                  recently proposed matrix-based R{\'e}nyi's $\alpha$-entropy
                  functional to estimate MI values in each entry of the MI
                  matrix. The new estimator avoids density estimation and it
                  operates on the eigenspectrum of a (normalized) symmetric
                  positive definite (SPD) matrix, which makes it well suited for
                  industrial process. We combine different orders of statistics
                  of the transformed components (TCs) extracted from the MI
                  matrix to constitute the detection index, and derive a simple
                  similarity index to monitor the changes of characteristics of
                  the underlying process in consecutive windows. We term the
                  overall methodology "projections of mutual information matrix"
                  (PMIM). Experiments on both synthetic data and the benchmark
                  Tennessee Eastman process demonstrate the interpretability of
                  PMIM in identifying the root variables that cause the faults,
                  and its superiority in detecting the occurrence of faults in
                  terms of the improved fault detection rate (FDR) and the
                  lowest false alarm rate (FAR). The advantages of PMIM is also
                  less sensitive to hyper-parameters. The advantages of PMIM is
                  also less sensitive to hyper-parameters. Code of PMIM is

                  of a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme in the
                  context of cyber-security. We consider different types of the
                  so-called insider attacks. In particular, we consider the
                  situation where one of the local controllers sends false
                  information to others to manipulate costs for its own
                  advantage. Then, we propose a popular scenario-based mechanism
                  to protect or, at least, relieve the consequences of the
                  attack in a typical DMPC negotiation process. The theoretical
                  and algorithmic properties of this defense mechanism are also
                  analyzed. A real case study based on a four tank plant is
                  provided to illustrate both the consequences of the attacks
                  and the defense mechanisms.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new generalized attack separation
                  scheme in energy internet to analyze how an attacker behaves.
                  This scheme consists of a robust interval state
                  estimation-based anomaly detection method and a coordinated
                  bad data processor. We develop an anomaly detection method
                  that takes system uncertainties, i.e., forecasting uncertainty
                  and parameter perturbation, into account to approximate the
                  largest possible deviations of state variables in smart grid,
                  thus recognizing stealthy anomalies. In this method, we
                  decouple the power balancing formulation into P-$\theta$ and
                  Q-V sub-problems to improve the computational efficiency.
                  Thereafter, a new coordinated bad data processor is proposed
                  to automatically filter out the impact of malicious attacks on
                  state estimation and to reconstruct the real states of a cyber
                  physical smart grid. In this processor, three-stage state
                  estimator is applied to rapidly assess the biased state from
                  the current observations with the contamination of meters and
                  communication channels. As a result, the implemented attack
                  vector can be separated and isolated from the current
                  observations online. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated
                  via comprehensive tests on several IEEE systems. The obtained
                  results show the strong robustness, high stability and
                  promising performance for attack separation, indicating a high
                  potential of the proposed scheme for practical implementations
                  in deep-cyber penetrated smart grids.},

                  intermittent control, which is more difficult to study due to
                  the fact that the Laplacian matrix corresponding to the
                  directed topology is an asymmetric matrix. In our study, both

                  in the analysis of cyber-physical systems. It captures the
                  plausible deniability of the system's secret behavior in the
                  presence of an intruder that may access the information flow.
                  Existing works on opacity only consider nonmetric systems by
                  assuming that the intruder can always distinguish between two
                  different outputs precisely. In this article, we extend the
                  concept of opacity to systems whose output sets are equipped
                  with metrics. Such systems are widely used in the modeling of
                  many real-world systems whose measurements are physical
                  signals. A new concept called approximate opacity is proposed
                  in order to quantitatively evaluate the security guarantee
                  level with respect to the measurement precision of the
                  intruder. Then, we propose a new simulation-type relation,
                  called approximate opacity-preserving simulation relation,
                  which characterizes how close two systems are in terms of the
                  satisfaction of approximate opacity. This allows us to verify
                  approximate opacity for large-scale, or even infinite, systems
                  using their abstractions. We also discuss how to construct
                  approximate opacity-preserving symbolic models for a class of
                  discrete-time control systems. Our results extend the
                  definitions and analysis techniques for opacity from nonmetric
                  systems to metric systems.},

                  of insufficient water supply, some users' water demand is
                  affected. Because the operation cost is positively related to
                  the number of users whose water demand cannot be met, making
                  the most of the limited water sources to meet the water demand
                  of as many users as possible is the key to reduce the related
                  cost in the operation optimization. Considering the
                  time-varying of users' water demand and the dynamic
                  characteristics of WDNs, real-time dynamic operation
                  optimization of WDNs is required. In this paper, an economic
                  cost function which connects the cost incurred by the risks
                  and the controllable pressure is proposed based on the
                  distribution of users and the corresponding water supply
                  method. An EMPC strategy with the ability to guarantee the
                  closed-loop stability is adopted for the optimization problem.
                  Performance of the proposed methods is illustrated based on
                  the simulation of the Newtown case at different risk levels.
                  Simulation results show that the extra cost decreases greatly
                  in the situation with risks by applying the proposed
                  pressure-related economic function and the EMPC strategy.},

  abstract = {A class of resource allocation problems with equality constraint are considered in this paper, such as economic dispatch problem in smart grid systems, which is essentially an optimization problem. Inspired by the Lagrange multiplier method, the resource allocation problem is transformed into a multi-agent consensus problem for large-scale networked distributed nodes. A consensus-based distributed fixed-time optimization algorithm is presented, where the information exchange network is depicted by a strongly connected and weight-balanced digraph. This type of communication network can ensure that the equality constraint always holds. Moreover, a new globally fixed-time stability theorem for nonlinear systems is first given in this paper. Based on this theorem and consensus theory, the optimal resource allocation scheme can be given in a fixed time. Finally, the application and comparison of the designed algorithm show that the algorithm can effectively solve the allocation problem of power resources such as economic dispatch.},

                  predictive control in cyber-physical systems under false data
                  injection attack, and a resilient control strategy is proposed
                  based on control signal reconstruction. Firstly, the
                  continuous control signal is discretely sampled at the
                  controller side, and the key data samples are determined and
                  protected. Then, the discretised control samples are
                  transmitted through the network channel, based on which the
                  control signal is reconstructed at the controlled system side
                  according to a preset mode. It is further theoretically proved
                  that the control signals reconstructed from the critical
                  control samples can guarantee the feasibility and stability of
                  the control system against the FDI attacks. Finally, a
                  simulation verification on a robot system is conducted to
                  verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this paper a scenario-based Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) approach based on a reduced scenario tree is developed for large-scale freeway networks. In the new scenario-based DMPC approach, uncertainties in a large-scale freeway network are distinguished into two categories: global uncertainties for the overall network and local uncertainties applicable to subnetworks only. We propose to use a reduced scenario tree instead of using a complete scenario tree. A complete scenario tree is defined as a scenario tree consisting of global scenarios and all the combinations of the local scenarios for all subnetworks, while a reduced scenario tree is defined as a scenario tree consisting of global scenarios and a reduced local scenario tree in which local scenarios are combined within each subnetwork, not among subnetworks. Moreover, an expected-value setting and a min–max setting are considered for handling uncertainties in scenario-based DMPC. In the expected-value setting, the expected-value of the cost function values for all considered uncertainty scenarios is optimized by scenario-based DMPC. However, in the min–max setting, the worst-case of the cost function values for all considered uncertainty scenarios is optimized by scenario-based DMPC. The results for a numerical experiment show that the new scenario-based DMPC approach is effective in improving the control performance while at the same time satisfying the queue constraints in the presence of uncertainties. Additionally, the proposed approach results in a relatively low computational burden compared to the case with the complete scenario tree.},

                  the runtime computational effort from Model Predictive Control
                  (MPC) by computing offline the overall optimization procedure.
                  The result from eMPC is a Piecewise Affine (PWA) function that
                  defines a relationship between the system state and the
                  optimal control action. To improve the PWA evaluation during
                  runtime, Binary Search Trees (BST) are employed to represent
                  PWA functions, which may be time prohibitive considering the
                  total time to obtain the tree. This note presents a new
                  classification strategy of polyhedral regions with respect to
                  hyperplanes to build BST for PWA functions. The proposed

                  half in the number of optimization problems, and consequently,
                  in the total time to build the BST, which is the main

                  verified on numerical examples of different sizes, where the

  abstract = {Abstract In this work, a novel approach on active fault detection and isolation for linear time-invariant systems, named forced diagnosability, is proposed. This approach computes a continuous state feedback law to render a fault diagnosable, even when it cannot be diagnosed by using passive diagnosis methods. To do that, this work derives novel geometric relationships between unobservability and (A,B)\$\$ \left(A,B\right) \$\$-invariant subspaces that, under certain conditions, guarantee the existence of such state feedback law. The objective of the state feedback law is to force all the faults, except the one required to be diagnosed, named Ld\$\$ {L}\_d \$\$, to reside in an unobservability subspace. This effectively decouples the effect of Ld\$\$ {L}\_d \$\$ on the system output, from the effect of the other faults, allowing the design of a residual generator to detect and isolate the desired fault. The proposed state feedback law continuously forces diagnosability, and it can be computed in polynomial time. This avoids testing faults only at fixed time intervals and solving complex optimization problems required in other active diagnosis approaches. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract        = {This paper is concerned with the identification of a class
                  of piecewise affine systems called a piecewise affine
                  autoregressive exogenous (PWARX) model. The PWARX model is
                  composed of ARX sub-models each of which corresponds to a
                  polyhedral region of the regression space. Under the temporary
                  assumption that the number of sub-models is known a priori,
                  the input-output data are collected into several clusters by
                  using a statistical clustering algorithm. We utilize support
                  vector classifiers to estimate the boundary hyperplane between
                  two adjacent regions in the regression space. In each cluster,
                  the parameter vector of the sub-model is obtained by the least
                  squares method. It turns out that the present statistical
                  clustering approach enables us to estimate the number of
                  sub-models based on the information criteria such as CAIC and
                  MDL. The estimate of the number of sub-models is performed by
                  applying the identification procedure several times to the
                  same data set, after having fixed the number of sub-models to
                  different values. Finally, we verify the applicability of the
                  present identification method through a numerical example of a
                  Hammerstein model.},

                  the study of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), a field that has
                  recently garnered increased attention. A key concern that is
                  ubiquitous in CPS is a need to ensure security in the face of
                  cyber attacks. In this paper, we carry out a survey of systems
                  and control methods that have been proposed for the security
                  of CPS. We classify these methods into three categories based
                  on the type of defense proposed against the cyberattacks:
                  prevention, resilience, and detection \& isolation. A unified
                  threat assessment metric is proposed in order to evaluate how
                  CPS security is achieved in each of these three cases. Also
                  surveyed are the risk assessment tools and the effect of
                  network topology on CPS security. Furthermore, an emphasis has

  abstract        = {Abstract This work focuses on a class of nonlinear control
                  problems that arise when new control systems which may use
                  networked sensors and/or actuators are added to already
                  operating control loops to improve closed-loop performance. In
                  this case, it is desirable to design the pre-existing control
                  system and the new control system in a way such that they
                  coordinate their actions. To address this control problem, a
                  distributed model predictive control method is introduced
                  where both the pre-existing control system and the new control
                  system are designed via Lyapunov-based model predictive
                  control. Working with general nonlinear models of chemical
                  processes and assuming that there exists a Lyapunov-based
                  controller that stabilizes the nominal closed-loop system
                  using only the pre-existing control loops, two separate
                  Lyapunov-based model predictive controllers are designed that
                  coordinate their actions in an efficient fashion.
                  Specifically, the proposed distributed model predictive
                  control design preserves the stability properties of the
                  Lyapunov-based controller, improves the closed-loop
                  performance, and allows handling input constraints. In
                  addition, the proposed distributed control design requires
                  reduced communication between the two distributed controllers
                  since it requires that these controllers communicate only once
                  at each sampling time and is computationally more efficient
                  compared to the corresponding centralized model predictive
                  control design. The theoretical results are illustrated using
                  a chemical process example. © 2009 American Institute of

  abstract        = "In this chapter we present a popular class of distributed
                  algorithms, known as linear consensus algorithms, which have
                  the ability to compute the global average of local quantities.
                  These algorithms are particularly suitable in the context of
                  multi-agent systems and networked control systems, i.e.
                  control systems that are physically distributed and cooperate
                  by exchanging information through a communication network. We
                  present the main results available in the literature about the
                  analysis and design of linear consensus algorithms,for both
                  synchronous and asynchronous implementations. We then show
                  that many control, optimization and estimation problems such
                  as least squares, sensor calibration, vehicle coordination and
                  Kalman filtering can be cast as the computation of some sort
                  of averages, therefore being suitable for consensus
                  algorithms. We finally conclude by presenting very recent
                  studies about the performance of many of these control and
                  estimation problems, which give rise to novel metrics for the
                  consensus algorithms. These indexes of performance are rather
                  different from more traditional metrics like the rate of
                  convergence and have fundamental consequences on the design of
                  consensus algorithms.",

                  high penetration rate of renewable energy generation is
                  proposed in this paper. First, to generate realistic wind and
                  solar scenarios for better training of DCNN, we built a dual
                  discriminator generative adversarial network (D2GAN). Second,
                  a DCNN for calculating the N-1 static security index of the
                  power grid was built. The inputs are operating conditions
                  constructed by the generated wind and solar power scenarios
                  and the line outages, and the output is the corresponding N-1
                  static security index. Finally, the numerical experimental
                  results based on the historical wind and solar power shows

                  of the harsh environmental, the event trigger threshold is
                  dynamically optimized with the external interference and
                  attacks to ensure the system with a certain resilience. Based
                  on an asynchronous event-triggered timing model, a control

                  constructed by being combined with the dynamic output feedback
                  control for different attack scenarios. Based on the feedback

                  attacks. A sampled-data robust model predictive control law
                  with a packet-based transmission scheduling is taken advantage
                  to compensate for the loss of the control data during the
                  intermittent DoS intervals, and an event-triggered control
                  strategy is designed to save communication and computation
                  resources. The robust constraint satisfaction and the
                  stability of the closed-loop system under DoS attacks are
                  proved. In contrast to the existing studies that guarantee the
                  system under DoS attacks is input-to-state stable, the
                  predicted input error caused by the system constraints can be
                  dealt with by the input-to-state practical stability
                  framework. Finally, a simulation example is performed to
                  verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed

                  approaches have achieved remarkable results in complex
                  multiple subsystems network applications, such as unmanned
                  aerial vehicle and sensor control networks. However, most of
                  the existing DMPC algorithms require that the communication
                  network of subsystems is time-invariant or undirected with
                  local constraints, by ignoring the cooperation of multiple
                  subsystems with global constraint in the non-ideal
                  communication network, which greatly limits the applicability
                  of the algorithms. To this end, the authors develop a fully
                  DMPC algorithm of linear system with global constraint over
                  time-varying unbalanced directed communication. Considering
                  the uncertainty of communication network, this algorithm can
                  handle the non-ideal communication network (e.g. communication
                  noise, communication delay). Specifically, the row-stochastic
                  weight matrix is adopted to improve the independent
                  controllability of subsystems. Under reasonable assumptions,
                  it is proved that the algorithm can converge to the optimal
                  solution while guaranteeing the recursive feasibility and
                  exponential stability of closed-loop system. Finally, the
                  simulation experiments are shown to substantiate the
                  convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},
