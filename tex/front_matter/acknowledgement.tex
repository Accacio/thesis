First, I thank God for \textbf{all the people} he put in my life.
They all served as example on who to be (or not).
The good and bad experiences made me the individual I am now.

Thanks to all my teachers and professors, who showed me the beauty of transposing knowledge from one's mind to others'.
You certainly instigated me to keep learning new things and inspired me to have a teaching experience during my Ph.D. studies.

I thank my parents, Rosemeri and Rogerio, for the unconditional love and selflessness to support my choices.
Thanks for the first education and the moral compass which guides me wherever I go. Tenho orgulho de ser filho de vocês. Obrigado por tudo, sem vocês não chegaria a lugar algum. Amo muito vocês! \footnote{I'm proud of being your son. Thanks for everything, I wouldn't get anywhere if it weren't for you. I love you very much!}

I thank my wife, Evelise.
These were difficult years for both of us, for diverse reasons, but just knowing you were there, made things lighter.
Thank you for choosing to be with me despite all randomness imposed in our lives.
Also thanks for your suggestions, it always comes in handy to have someone intelligent with critical thinking by my side.
I love you!

I thank my supervisors Hervé et Romain.
Thank you for accepting me as your Ph.D. student and for helping me with the initial bureaucracy.
Thanks for your patience when I was overwhelmed by the possible choices.
Taking a step back gives us a clearer overall picture.
Thanks for your guidance during these years, in research and in life.
Your impact in my life will never be forgotten.

I thank my Monitoring Committee, Malek Ghanes and Stanislav.
The discussions about publishing and academic life were invaluable.

I thank everybody in the AUT team of CentraleSupélec IETR for the warm reception.
It was nice to be here once again.
Thank you Pierre for the extensive discussions from the most diverse topics.
Thank you Nabil and Marie-Anne, for always being gentle and helpful, it was a pleasure to work with you on the other side of the curtain.
Thanks Paul for the tips on the academic life.
Thanks to my fellow Ph.D. students Marina, Joy, Elsy and Zhighang, for the exchanges that gave me other views of life.
I wish you well in the end of your studies.
And I also thank my other fellow Ph.D. students, now Doctors, Amanda, Xiang et Jesse-James.
Thanks for the help in my initial steps as a Ph.D student and all other moments we spent talking about work, life, music and games.

I also thank Professors Éric Bideaux, J.M. Maestre and Ionela Prodan for accepting being the examiners of my work.

And I thank you, reader, for your time. This is the work of 3 years of my life. Enjoy.
