\section{Context}
  \todo{Nowadays problems (large-scale \ldots) need to decompose, problems with security StuxnetÂ \cite{Langner2011} and other attacks (use examples in~\cite{DingEtAl2018})}%
  \todo{ more examples in \cite{Bindra2017}}

\section{Motivation and Contributions}
\todo{MPC handle constraints and optimize the control for a given set of objective, and due to its predictive nature it can profit from future predictions to foresee needs and act so they can be fulfilled.}

\todo{Not many works talk about security in \dmpc\ frameworks, recently increase awareness}

During the discussion in recent works two main questions were raised and this work gravitates around them:
\simplebox{
  \begin{itemize} \bfseries
    \item How can decomposition methods influence the security of a system?
    \item What can we do to increase its security?
  \end{itemize}
}

Since those questions are still open, this work has as objective to answer these questions.
The contributions of this work can be As a

\begin{itemize}
  \item General discussion about security in decomposition methods:
        \begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
          \item points of vulnerability;
          \item how malicious agents can benefit from them;
          \item effects on the overall system;
          \item possible ways to mitigate.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Use conclusions of discussion to develop safe algorithms for a \dmpc\ framework.
\end{itemize}
