\section{Possible Future directions}
As any research work, many questions emerged during the study and we were cronfronted with many crossroads which obliged us to choose one direction.

As inspiration for future works, we list some of those questions and paths not chosen. We list them in order of least backtracking needed, i.e., how fundamental the changes would need to be to achieve the study.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Study of robustness of the resilient strategy
  \item Study of the negotiation (and our resilient strategy) under communication noise
  \item \todo{Partial reconstruction of cheating matrix, when $\Plinineqtildeestimate$ is not available}
  \item Adaptation of resilient strategy when using soft constraints~\cite{AlessioBemporad2009}
  \item Use recursive \EM{} (or alternative) to estimate parameters
  \item Study of adapting our resilient strategy to use accelerated stop (as in~\cite{DaiEtAl2017})
  \item Study of our resilient strategy under other decomposition methods
  \item Study of other attack models (initially with affine cheating function)
\end{itemize}
