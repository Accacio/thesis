In this chapter, we carry on the work from the last chapter relaxing some assumptions to make the problem to be solved more generic.

We apply the primal decomposition to te problem,  and the we analyze its nominal solutions and when the system is under the proposed attack model.

From the analysis we see perceived that the relaxation of the assumption increase drastically the complexity of the problem.
